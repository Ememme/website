# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as a part of [*Learn Enough to be dangerous*](http:/learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the greatest git tutorial in the universe.

You should totally [check it out](http:/learnenough.com/git-tutorial) and be sure to [join the email list]((http:/learnenough.com/#email_list) and [follow @lesrnenough](http://twitter.com/learnenough) on Twitter.

After finishing *Learn Enough* Git to be Dangerous, I'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*.

This means I'll be able to use Git to track changes in my projects, back up data, and collaborate with other users of Git.
